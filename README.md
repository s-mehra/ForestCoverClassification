# Forest Cover Classification
A deep learning model to predict forest cover based on various cartographic features. 
The code performs cover type classification using a neural network model. It includes functions for building the model, plotting the training history, and generating a confusion matrix heatmap. The main function loads the dataset, conducts exploratory data analysis, splits the data, normalizes it, builds and trains the model, evaluates its performance, and produces classification results and visualizations.
